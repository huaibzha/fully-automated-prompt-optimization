# Fully Autonomous Prompt Optimization (FAPO)

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![CI](https://github.com/cisco-foundation-ai/fully-automated-prompt-optimization/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisco-foundation-ai/fully-automated-prompt-optimization/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An optimization framework for LLM-powered chains. Iteratively improve prompts, parameters, and chain architecture using built-in evaluation, failure analysis, and a structured variant system.

FAPO provides the full loop: **evaluate** a chain against a dataset, **analyze** what went wrong using step attribution, **create** a better variant, and **measure** whether it improved. The evaluation infrastructure exists to drive and measure optimization — not as an end in itself.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# For MCP support (agentic workflows with tool calling)
pip install -e ".[mcp]"
```

### 2. Set up a tenant

A tenant is a self-contained optimization project. You need four things: a dataset, a chain, a scorer, and a config that wires them together.

**Dataset** — a JSONL file with test cases (`my_dataset.jsonl`):
```json
{"case_id": "1", "task_type": "qa", "context": {"question": "What is the capital of France?"}, "expected": {"answer": "Paris"}, "metadata": {}}
{"case_id": "2", "task_type": "qa", "context": {"question": "What is 2 + 2?"}, "expected": {"answer": "4"}, "metadata": {}}
```

**Chain** — a LangGraph pipeline that processes each case (`my_chain.py`):
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from src.hephaestus.chains.types import ChainState
from src.hephaestus.chains.nodes import make_llm_node

def build_chain(provider, config):
    graph = StateGraph(ChainState)
    graph.add_node("answer", make_llm_node(
        provider=provider,
        prompt_template_path=config["prompt_paths"]["answer"],
        output_key="answer",
    ))
    graph.set_entry_point("answer")
    graph.add_edge("answer", END)
    return graph.compile()
```

**Scorer** — compares chain output to expected answers (`my_scorer.py`):
```python
from src.hephaestus.scoring.scorer import Scorer as BaseScorer

class Scorer(BaseScorer):
    def validate_case(self, case, scoring_profile):
        assert "answer" in case.expected, "Missing 'answer' in expected"

    def score_case(self, case, output_text, scoring_profile):
        expected = case.expected["answer"].strip().lower()
        predicted = output_text.strip().lower()
        em = 100.0 if predicted == expected else 0.0
        return {"composite_score": em, "score_breakdown": {"exact_match": em}}
```

**Prompt template** — the LLM instructions with placeholders (`prompt.md`):
```
System: You are a helpful assistant. Answer concisely in as few words as possible.

User: ${question}
```

**Config** — ties everything together (`eval.json`):
```json
{
  "tenant_id": "my_project",
  "provider": "openai",
  "provider_settings": { "model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 1024 },
  "dataset": { "path": "my_dataset.jsonl" },
  "chain": {
    "path": "my_chain.py",
    "fn": "build_chain",
    "config": { "prompt_paths": { "answer": "prompt.md" } }
  },
  "scoring_profile": { "scorer": { "module_path": "my_scorer.py", "class_name": "Scorer" } },
  "output_dir": "eval_output/"
}
```

### 3. Run a baseline eval

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
python -m hephaestus.cli eval --config eval.json
cat eval_output/summary.md
```

### 4. Optimize

Open Codex in your project directory and ask it to follow the FAPO optimization workflow:

```
Optimize tenant my_project using eval.json.
Success criteria: composite_score >= 90.
Follow .codex/agents/optimization.md.
```

For repeated autonomous rounds from the terminal, use the Codex loop script:

```bash
scripts/optimize-loop-codex.sh \
  --tenant my_project \
  --config eval.json \
  --goal "composite_score >= 90"
```

The agent autonomously analyzes failures, creates improved prompt variants, evaluates them, and iterates until your target score is reached. See [Optimization loop](#optimization-loop) for the full details.

---

## How it works

The core workflow is an **optimization loop** — evaluate, analyze failures, create a better variant, repeat:

```
  ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                       OPTIMIZATION LOOP                       │
  │                                                               │
  │  Dataset ──> Chain ──> Scorer ──> Results                     │
  │  (JSONL)     (LangGraph)          (summary.md, results.jsonl) │
  │                                       │                       │
  │                                       ▼                       │

  │                                       │                       │
  │                                       ▼                       │
  │                            Create new variant                 │
  │                     (prompt / parameter / chain)              │
  │                                       │                       │
  │                                       ▼                       │
  │           ┌── Accept ◄── Compare to previous best             │
  │           │                      │                            │
  │           ▼                 Reject ──┐                        │
  │      Update best                     │                        │
  │           │                          │                        │
  │           └───────────► Next cycle ◄─┘                        │
  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You wire them together with a **config file** and run `python -m hephaestus.cli eval --config <config>.json`. Once you have results, use failure analysis and the variant system to iterate.

---

## Concepts

### Datasets

A dataset is a JSONL file. Each line is one test case:

```json
{
  "case_id": "unique-id",
  "task_type": "qa",
  "context": {
    "question": "Your input field(s) here"
  },
  "expected": {
    "answer": "The correct output"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "difficulty": "hard",
    "source": "manual"
  }
}
```

- **`case_id`** — unique identifier for the case (required)
- **`task_type`** — label for the kind of task, e.g. `"qa"`, `"summarization"` (required)
- **`context`** — key-value pairs passed into your chain as input variables (required)
- **`expected`** — ground truth used by your scorer (required; the schema inside `expected` is up to your scorer -- the engine does not inspect it)
- **`metadata`** — arbitrary key-value pairs for filtering and analysis (required, may be `{}`)

### Chains

A chain is a [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) state graph that processes each test case. You define it as a Python module with a `build_chain` function (see the [Quick start](#quick-start) for a minimal single-node example).

**`make_llm_node`** reads a prompt template, substitutes `${variables}` from the chain state, calls the LLM, and writes the response back to state.

For multi-step chains, add more nodes and edges:

```python
def build_chain(provider, config):
    graph = StateGraph(ChainState)

    graph.add_node("retrieve", my_retrieval_node)
    graph.add_node("summarize", make_llm_node(
        provider=provider,
        prompt_template_path=config["prompt_paths"]["summarize"],
        output_key="summary",
    ))
    graph.add_node("answer", make_llm_node(
        provider=provider,
        prompt_template_path=config["prompt_paths"]["answer"],
        output_key="answer",
    ))

    graph.set_entry_point("retrieve")
    graph.add_edge("retrieve", "summarize")
    graph.add_edge("summarize", "answer")
    graph.add_edge("answer", END)

    return graph.compile()
```

Later nodes can reference earlier outputs in their prompts using `${steps.summarize.output}`.

### Prompt templates

Prompts are Markdown files with a simple format:

```
System: You are a helpful assistant.

User: Answer the following question concisely.

Question: ${question}
Context: ${steps.retrieve.output}
```

- `${question}` is replaced by `context.question` from the dataset case
- `${steps.<node_name>.output}` is replaced by the output of a previous chain node
- Missing variables are logged as diagnostics (not hard errors)

### Scorers

A scorer compares the chain output to the expected answer. Implement the `Scorer` base class:

```python
# my_scorer.py
from hephaestus.scoring.scorer import Scorer as BaseScorer

class Scorer(BaseScorer):
    def validate_case(self, case, scoring_profile):
        """Check that each case has the fields this scorer needs."""
        assert "answer" in case.expected, f"Case {case.case_id}: missing 'answer'"

    def score_case(self, case, output_text, scoring_profile):
        expected = case.expected["answer"].strip().lower()
        predicted = output_text.strip().lower()

        exact_match = 100.0 if predicted == expected else 0.0
        contains = 100.0 if expected in predicted else 0.0
        composite = 0.6 * exact_match + 0.4 * contains

        return {
            "composite_score": composite,     # 0-100, required
            "score_breakdown": {              # required dict — track individual metrics
                "exact_match": exact_match,
                "contains_answer": contains,
            },
        }
```

The engine calls `validate_case` (to catch bad data early) then `score_case` for each test case, and aggregates the results.

For multi-step chains, you can also implement `score_pipeline_case` to score based on intermediate step outputs, not just the final output.

### Providers

FAPO supports three LLM providers out of the box:

| Provider | Config value | Auth env variable | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **OpenAI** | `"openai"` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o1/o3 reasoning models |
| **Baseten** | `"baseten"` | `BASETEN_API_KEY` | Custom model deployments |
| **SageMaker** | `"sagemaker"` | Configurable via `api_key_env` | AWS-hosted endpoints |

Provider settings go in the config file:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "provider_settings": {
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.0,
    "max_tokens": 4096,
    "timeout_seconds": 300,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "retry_backoff_seconds": 5
  }
}
```

---

## Optimization loop

Evaluation tells you *how well* your chain performs. Optimization tells you *what to change* to make it better. FAPO includes a structured optimization loop that works at three levels of increasing cost. (For the full architecture, see [docs/processes/prompt-iteration-loop.md](docs/processes/prompt-iteration-loop.md).)

### Running it

The optimization loop is driven by Codex workflow prompts under `.codex/`. From within your project directory:

```bash
# 1. Run a baseline eval first
python scripts/eval/run_eval_and_summarize.py \
  --config tenants/my_project/configs/eval.json

# 2. Start the autonomous optimization loop
scripts/optimize-loop-codex.sh \
  --tenant my_project \
  --config tenants/my_project/configs/eval.json \
  --goal "composite_score >= 80"
```

The Codex optimization workflow takes over from there. It will:
1. Read the tenant's `docs/iteration-playbook.md` to understand what it's allowed to change (the **scope contract**)
2. Run failure analysis on the eval results
3. Create new prompt/parameter/chain variants targeting the top failure patterns
4. Validate each variant through an independent guardrail review
5. Run eval on the new variant and compare to the previous best
6. Repeat until success criteria are met or all allowed optimization levels are exhausted

The workflow uses two internal review phases:
- **step-attribution** - classifies failures by root cause after each eval
- **variant-reviewer** - checks proposed variants for leakage, placeholder drift, and scope violations before eval

You can also run evals and optimization steps manually via the CLI (see [CLI reference](#cli-reference) below), but the agent handles the full loop autonomously.

### The three optimization levels

| Level | What changes | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Prompt** (lowest cost) | Prompt template text only | Add "answer in one word" to reduce verbosity |
| **Parameter** (medium cost) | Config values only | Change `retrieval_k` from 7 to 10, or `temperature` from 1.0 to 0.5 |
| **Structural** (highest cost) | Chain topology / new nodes | Add a self-reflection node, switch from linear to ReAct pattern |

The system works through these levels in order. When performance plateaus at one level, it escalates to the next.

### Step attribution (failure analysis)

After an eval run, step attribution automatically classifies each failure by root cause:

- **Retrieval failures** — the retrieval step returned empty or irrelevant content
- **Cascading failures** — an early step produced empty output, causing everything downstream to fail
- **Format failures** — the correct answer is in the output but surrounded by extra text the scorer can't parse
- **Reasoning failures** — all inputs were good but the model reached the wrong conclusion

Each failure is also tagged by which optimization level can address it:
- Format and reasoning failures → **prompt-addressable**
- Retrieval and cascade failures → **structural-addressable**

This tells you where to focus effort before you start writing new variants.

### Prompt variants

Prompts live at `tenants/<tenant_id>/prompts/modules/<module>/variant-NNN.md`. Each variant is a new file — you never edit in place:

```
prompts/modules/generate_answer/
├── variant-001.md    # Baseline (minimal instructions)
├── variant-002.md    # Added answer brevity rules
└── variant-003.md    # Added must-always-answer constraint
```

To test a new variant, create a config that points to it:

```json
{
  "chain": {
    "config": {
      "prompt_paths": {
        "generate_answer": "tenants/my_project/prompts/modules/generate_answer/variant-002.md"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then run eval with that config. Each variant gets its own eval output — no collisions.

### Tracking what you tried

Each tenant tracks optimization history in two places:

**`docs/iteration-memory.jsonl`** — structured, one record per cycle:
```json
{
  "iteration": 1,
  "variant": "variant-002",
  "modules_changed": ["generate_answer", "summarize1"],
  "hypothesis": "Answer brevity rules will improve exact match",
  "train_em": 74.67,
  "val_em": 65.67,
  "delta_val": 26.34,
  "accepted": true
}
```

**`docs/change-log.md`** — human-readable narrative of what changed and why.

Together these prevent rework (you won't re-try something that already failed) and provide an audit trail of how scores improved over time.

### Example: optimizing a multi-hop QA chain

Starting from a baseline with 39% exact match on the validation set:

| Iteration | Change | Val EM | Delta |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Baseline (variant-001) | Minimal DSPy-format prompts | 39.3% | — |
| Iteration 1 (variant-002) | Added task-specific rules: answer brevity, no explanations | 65.7% | +26.4pp |
| Iteration 2 (variant-003) | Added must-always-answer, singular form guidance | 70.3% | +4.6pp |

After iteration 2, failure analysis showed remaining failures were mostly retrieval-limited (the right documents weren't being retrieved) — a structural problem that prompt changes alone can't fix. This is the kind of signal that tells you when to stop iterating at one level and move to the next.

---

## CLI reference

### `eval` — Run an evaluation

```bash
python -m hephaestus.cli eval --config path/to/config.json
```

Runs the chain on every case in the dataset, scores each output, and writes results to `output_dir`.

**Outputs:**
| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `summary.md` | Human-readable score summary with breakdowns and step timings |
| `results.jsonl` | Per-case results (input, output, scores, diagnostics) |
| `run_config.json` | Snapshot of the config used for this run |
| `progress.json` | Real-time progress (useful for long-running evals) |

### `eval-progress` — Check a running evaluation

```bash
python -m hephaestus.cli eval-progress --output-dir path/to/output/
python -m hephaestus.cli eval-progress --output-dir path/to/output/ --json
```

Shows run status, progress (completed/total), and current average score.

### `customer-data` — Sync datasets with GCS

```bash
# Pull datasets from GCS
python -m hephaestus.cli customer-data pull --tenant my_project --scope derived

# Push local datasets to GCS
python -m hephaestus.cli customer-data push --tenant my_project --scope derived

# Remove local copies
python -m hephaestus.cli customer-data remove-local --tenant my_project --scope raw --yes
```

Scopes: `raw` (source artifacts), `derived` (processed datasets), `all`.

---

## Codex workflows

FAPO ships with Codex workflow prompts that automate common workflows. In Codex, ask for the workflow in plain language; in terminal automation, use `codex exec` or the provided loop script.

### User-invocable workflows

| Workflow | File | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Optimization** | `.codex/agents/optimization.md` | Autonomous optimization loop: analyzes failures, creates variants, runs evals, iterates until target score is reached. See [Optimization loop](#optimization-loop). |
| **Eval Runner** | `.codex/commands/eval-runner.md` | Runs a tenant evaluation and returns a score summary. |
| **Synthetic Samples** | `.codex/commands/synthetic-samples.md` | Creates realistic synthetic test cases to augment eval datasets with edge cases. |
| **Synthetic Pruner** | `.codex/commands/synthetic-pruner.md` | Prunes noncompliant synthetic examples and normalizes placeholder data. |
| **Reset Tenant** | `.codex/commands/reset-tenant.md` | Resets a tenant to baseline (variant-001), removing optimization artifacts after confirmation. |

### Internal phases

These are used by the optimization workflow; you usually don't run them directly:

| Phase | File | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Step Attribution** | `.codex/agents/step-attribution.md` | Post-eval failure analysis. Classifies failures by root cause and optimization level. |
| **Variant Reviewer** | `.codex/agents/variant-reviewer.md` | Independent guardrail check on proposed variants. |

Legacy Claude Code assets remain under `.claude/` for teams that still run the original slash-command workflow.

```

The key design principle: **everything in `src/hephaestus/` is generic**. Everything tenant-specific lives under `tenants/<tenant_id>/`.

---

## Creating a new tenant

A tenant is a self-contained optimization project. Create the directory structure, then add the same four components shown in [Quick start](#quick-start) (dataset, chain, scorer, config):

```bash
mkdir -p tenants/my_project/{chains,prompts/modules,datasets,code/scorers,configs,evals,docs}
```

Additionally, create an **iteration playbook** at `tenants/my_project/docs/iteration-playbook.md` that defines which optimization levels are allowed (prompt, parameter, structural) and success criteria. The optimization agent reads this to determine its scope. See [docs/tenant-docs-contract.md](docs/tenant-docs-contract.md) for the full list of required tenant docs, and [docs/templates/tenant-docs/](docs/templates/tenant-docs/) for templates.

See `tenants/hotpotqa/` for a complete working example (multi-hop question answering with BM25 retrieval and a multi-node chain).
